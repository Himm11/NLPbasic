You are the sun that rose again in my life, the return of my childhood dreams. I donâ€™t know what this feeling is, perhaps this is also in a dream. Dream is a blue mirage in a desert, a priori from deep inside of me. I get breathtakingly euphoric. The surrounding becomes more and more transparent. I hear the ocean from far away. I walk across the dream over the forest and go towards that place as it gets clearer.
